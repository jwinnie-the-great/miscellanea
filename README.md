# miscellanea

putting this here as a "work sample" of sorts to demonstrate my programming skill. or something like that ...

## projects included

* **munapp** - web app for taking notes for MUN (Model United Nations), using Vue.js + Trix
* **history_flashcards** - CLI flashcards app written in Elixir. it was made to learn Elixir, and it looks up entries on Wikipedia automatically!
* **spam** - attempt at making a binary package manager in Rust. unfortunately I didn't get very far with this one due to issues with TAR extraction
